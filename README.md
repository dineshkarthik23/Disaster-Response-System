The disaster response system allows administrators 
to identify heavily landslide-affected areas by accessing a new map 
that highlights damaged routes and locations. This enables them to 
plan alternative evacuation routes. Additionally, administrators can 
swiftly input disaster details, access essential contact information, 
determine the shortest and safest routes, and locate nearby shelters 
or resources.
